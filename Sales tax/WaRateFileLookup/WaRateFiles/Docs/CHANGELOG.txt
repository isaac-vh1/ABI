8/5/2011-FileMaintenance.PingFile() was updated to look for the file case insensitive.
8/8/2008
- FileMaintenance.IsUpdateAvailable() was modified to only make 1 web request to the files download page.
- FileMaintenance.UpdateFiles() was modified to only make 1 web request to the files download page.
	To accomplish this the PingFile() method now accepts the HTML of the Web Request 
	as a parameter and a GetDownloadPageHTML() method was created to do the actual web request. 
	The web request call was pulled out of PingFile() and added to the IsUpdateAvailable() and 
	UpdateFiles() methods.
